# spendings_tracker

The spendings_tracker project, but written in Python instead. Currently a WIP, but I got as many things done in one day as opposed to 48 hours in comparison to the C++ version. Of course, this one is a lot slower in comparison (and a lot less impressive I think), but it is good at just making it work.

To-Do:

 - Set up command-line arguments for interacting with the program
 
 - Work with pickle to allow for storage of class data between usage
 
 A "version 0.1" will probably come out when all the basic functionalities are, well, functional enough for me to be able to use it on a daily basis.
